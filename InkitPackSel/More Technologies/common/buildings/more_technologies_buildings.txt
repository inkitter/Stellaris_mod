# Possible Variables for Buildings:
# strategic_resource: strategic resource, deprecated, strategic resource used by the building.
# allow: trigger to check for allowing construction of building.
# prerequisites: Tech requirements for building.
# empire_unique: boolean, can only build one if set to true.
# cost: resource table, cost of building.
# is_orbital: boolean, can only be built in orbital station.
# modifier: modifier, deprecated, applies a modifier to planet.
# base_buildtime: int, number of days for construction.
# requires_pop, boolean, building will require a pop for production.
# required_resources, resource table, required resources for production.
# produced_resources, resource table, produced resources in production.
# upgrades, buildings list, buildings this building can upgrade into.
# is_listed, boolean, toggles if this building is shown in the non-upgrade buildable list.
# planet_unique, toggles if one can build multiple of this type on a single planet.

#
# BALANCE
# can change the time and cost of all common buildings with these variables below
